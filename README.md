# About Me

Hey there,
I am a data analyst and data blogger with keen interests in graph data science and deep learning. During my undergrad at the University of Sydney I completed a Bachelor of Science and Advanced Studies  (Data Science and Archaeology). I am currently pursuing a Master of Data Science at Macquarie University and set to complete it at the end of 2024.

My projects span from my Master's course work to combining my love of history with data.

Most recently I have completed my final thesis "Analysing YOLO variants and State-of-the-art Methods for Cell Detection and Counting Challenges".

And, currently I am working on Graphing the Atlantic Slave Trade using Networking and Community Detection algorithms in Neo4j.

I've collaborated with the University of Sydney for *Sydney Data Stories* sharing my journey as a data analyst within the consulting sphere.

In my spare time, you can find me on the cycle track or the pool, or exploring my city.

Want to know more about my work? Check out my blog series on Medium at [@johannajones00](https://medium.com/@johannajones00) where I talk about my projects as I complete them, share resources and any bumps I experience along the way!

In this proposal, we take the position of Frontier Touring and propose a strategic initative of Satellite Viewing options to capture more of the market share and drive malicious activities such as scalping down. 

This project seeks to demonstrate our project management skills in ideating and proposing a solution that strategically aligns with Frontier Touring's commercial and organisational objectives.
