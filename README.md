# About Me

Hey there,
I am a data analyst and data blogger with keen interests in graph data science and deep learning. During my undergrad at the University of Sydney I completed a Bachelor of Science and Advanced Studies  (Data Science and Archaeology). I am currently pursuing a Master of Data Science at Macquarie University and set to complete it at the end of 2024.

My projects span from my Master's course work to combining my love of history with data.

Most recently I have completed my final thesis "Analysing YOLO variants and State-of-the-art Methods for Cell Detection and Counting Challenges".

And, currently I am working on Graphing the Atlantic Slave Trade using Networking and Community Detection algorithms in Neo4j.

I've collaborated with the University of Sydney for *Sydney Data Stories* sharing my journey as a data analyst within the consulting sphere.

In my spare time, you can find me on the cycle track or the pool, or exploring my city.
