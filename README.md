# About Me

Hey there,
I am a data analyst and data blogger with keen interests in graph data science and deep learning. During my undergrad at the University of Sydney I completed a Bachelor of Science and Advanced Studies  (Data Science and Archaeology). I am currently pursuing a Master of Data Science at Macquarie University and set to complete it at the end of 2024.

My projects span from my Master's course work to combining my love of history with data.

Most recently I have completed my final thesis "Analysing YOLO variants and State-of-the-art Methods for Cell Detection and Counting Challenges".

And, currently I am working on Graphing the Atlantic Slave Trade using Networking and Community Detection algorithms in Neo4j.

I've collaborated with the University of Sydney for *Sydney Data Stories* sharing my journey as a data analyst within the consulting sphere.

In my spare time, you can find me on the cycle track or the pool, or exploring my city.

Want to know more about my work? Check out my blog series on Medium at [@johannajones00](https://medium.com/@johannajones00) where I talk about my projects as I complete them, share resources and any bumps I experience along the way!

### Frontier Touring's Satellite Concert Events
Taylor Swift is the hottest and possibly biggest music artist ever. However, her popularity and demand leaves several fans wanting more and ticketing companies wanting to make more. In this proposal, we take the position of Frontier Touring and propose a strategic initative of Satellite Viewing options to capture more of the market share and drive malicious activities such as scalping down. 

This project seeks to demonstrate our project management skills in ideating and proposing a solution that strategically aligns with Frontier Touring's commercial and organisational objectives.

Take a look at the report here: [Satellite Viewing](/Reports/FrontierTouring.pdf)


### Analysis of YOLO for Blood Cell Biomedical Images

For my Master's final thesis, I set out to analyse a set of blood cell images and determine whether the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework sitting under Ultralytics would actually serve the pathology sphere well, given its success in other contexts.

This project demonstrates my skills in 
- **Research** information synthesis, presentation and report writing
- **Management of computing systems and resources**: Used GADI, a supercomputer, UNIX, bash commands
- **Object Detection/ Deep Learning**: Hyperparameter tuning, image processing, analysis of performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall and IOU)

### Sydney Data Stories

In December 2023, I collaborated with the University of Sydney as part of their *Sydney Data Stories* series. *Sydney Data Stories* is a growing collection of data stories from across the University, that relate to a variety of different majors, programs, and degrees.

The Sydney Data Stories project began as a live masterclass series for undergraduate data science and statistics students, in semester 1, 2018. They invited University of Sydney researchers, graduate students, and alumni industry professionals to present on “how they use data in their research”, and “how they came to do what they do”.
